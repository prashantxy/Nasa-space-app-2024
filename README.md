## Project Overview

Our project is designed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge. We aim to inspire and educate users about the wonders of space through an engaging web app that combines technology and entertainment. Key components include:

- **Asteroid Detection**: Using machine learning models, the app identifies asteroids and predicts potential trajectories.
- **Keplerian Models**: The app visualizes the orbits of planets and other celestial bodies based on Keplerian parameters.
- **Interactive Game**: A fun and educational game where users learn about the solar system while progressing through different levels.
- **Blockchain Reward System**: Users are rewarded with blockchain-based tokens for completing educational tasks and challenges within the app.

## Features

1. **Asteroid Detection ML Model**: Detects asteroids using real-time data and predicts their trajectories.
2. **Keplerian Models**: Calculates and visualizes the orbits of celestial objects, providing a hands-on learning experience.
3. **Educational Game**: Teaches players about the solar system and space exploration while making learning fun.
4. **Blockchain Rewards**: A decentralized system that rewards users with tokens for successfully completing game levels and educational challenges.

## Machine Learning Models

- **Asteroid Detection**: Utilizes real-time data from NASA APIs to identify and predict the paths of asteroids.
- **Keplerian Model**: Implements calculations to track and simulate the orbits of planets and other bodies using Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.

## Educational Game

The web app features a game that helps players explore and learn about the solar system. The game includes:
- Interactive quizzes and challenges.
- Planetary simulations with real-time physics models.
- Levels that progressively teach concepts about space and the universe.

## Blockchain Reward System

We integrated a blockchain-based rewards system that incentivizes learning through token-based rewards. Users can:
- Earn tokens by completing educational tasks.
- Use tokens to unlock additional content or educational materials.
- The reward system ensures transparency and security using blockchain technology.
